Project Description: To-Do List REST API
In this project, you will build a To-Do list application using Python Flask, where users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their tasks. 
You'll implement the REST API endpoints that handle these operations.

Design the API with the following endpoints:
GET /tasks: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
POST /tasks: Create a new task.
GET /tasks/<task_id>: Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
PUT /tasks/<task_id>: Update a specific task by its ID.
DELETE /tasks/<task_id>: Delete a specific task by its ID.
Each task should have a title and a description.
Handle error cases properly, such as when a task is not found, etc.
