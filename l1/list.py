# Data structures
# List, Dict, Set, Tuples

# Problem:
# You are given a list of integers. Your task is to find the second largest number in the list.

# Write a Python function called find_second_largest(numbers) that takes a list of integers as input and returns the second largest number in the list.
# numbers = [5, 2, 7, 3, 9, 1]
# result = find_second_largest(numbers)
# print(result)  # Output: 7


if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = [5, 2, 7, 3, 9, 1]
    # sort x sorted
    a = numbers.sort()
    print(a)
